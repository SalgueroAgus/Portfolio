## Description

This is a ReactJS based personal portfolio website. Because data is fed directly from a  JS File, this means that this means you can use and customize it for personal use by simply filling your own personal info into the resumeData.js file and the changes will be dynamically fed into the site. If you would like to use this template for your own personal resume website, read on to learn how to build your own copy.

## Make it Your Own!

### 1. Download the template

Download the code by cloning the repository to your local storage o simply download the zip archive. All you will have to do now is run `npm install`. Once everything finished installing, if you run `npm start` you should see that your app renders the same as the one at the live demo link above.

### 2. Replace images and fonts

Next, you will want to replace the images, and fonts if you like, with your own. All you have to do is replace the images at public/images/ and public/favicon.ico with your own. <em>YOU MUST KEEP THE SAME NAMES ON THE IMAGES.</em>

### 3. Fill in your personal info

To populate the website with all of your own data, open the src/resumeData.js file and simply replace the data in there with your own. Images for the projects section are to be put in the public/images/projects folder.

### 4. Make any styling changes you would like

Of course, all of the code is there and nothing is hidden from you so if you would like to make any other styling changes, feel free to do so in src/css/App.scss and MediaQueries.scss

### 5. Enjoy your new Resume Website

When you're all done, run `npm start` again and you'll see your new personal resume website! Congratulations!
